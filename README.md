# text-mining-nietzsche
Topic modeling of Friedrich Nietzsche's published works, all of which were made available by the [Gutenberg project](http://www.gutenberg.org/). 
The analysis calculates word frequencies within and across Nietzsche's 18 published titles.
A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was also used to model topcis within a subset of Nietzsche's books, particularly *We Philologists* and *Thoughts Out of Season Part 2*.
